Here is a brief explanation of how to use the console application to calculate the next 20 leap years:

When you run the application, it will display the next 20 leap years, starting from the current year.
The application uses the GetNextLeapYear method to find the next leap year after the current year. It then increments the current year to the next leap year and repeats the process until it has found 20 leap years.
The IsLeapYear method is used to determine whether a year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
To use the application, simply run it and wait for it to display the next 20 leap years. You can also modify the currentYear variable in the Main method to start the search for leap years from a different year.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a brief explanation of how to use the IsLeapYear method:

The IsLeapYear method takes an integer year as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year.
The method first checks if the year is divisible by 4. If it is not, the method returns false, indicating that the year is not a leap year.
If the year is divisible by 4, the method checks if it is divisible by 100. If it is, the method returns false unless the year is also divisible by 400.
If the year is divisible by 400, the method returns true, indicating that the year is a leap year.
